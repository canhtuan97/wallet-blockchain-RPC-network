# Checkit.js

**Chubby-Chocobo** note: I found and used this cool module for request parameters verifying in my web project. I need some more features, but the original project seems to be no longer maintained. Then I forked and update this by myself to get it work asap.

Original project can be found here: https://github.com/tgriesser/checkit

```
  TODO: write down the additional features here.
```
